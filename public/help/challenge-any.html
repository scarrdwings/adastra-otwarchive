<h4>Choosing Any</h4>

<p>
  If you choose "Any" for a field when you are filling out your sign-up, that means that you will be matched 
  on this field NO MATTER WHAT -- so this is potentially risky! Please be sure that you really mean ANY! 
  Even if you also fill out the field, the "Any" option will override anything else you put in there.
</p>
  
<h5>Some examples</h5>

<p>Offering any:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You offer the fandom "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" and choose "Any" for relationships.</li>
  <li>Mary Sue requests "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" as her fandom and the relationship "Christopher Pike/Una Chin-Riley"</li>
  <li>You can match Mary Sue and will be expected to write a story about the epic love of Pike and Una.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requesting any: (this is often especially confusing!)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mary Sue offers the fandom "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" and the relationship "Christopher Pike/Una Chin-Riley"</li>
  <li>You request the fandom "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" and choose "Any" for relationships.</li>
  <li>Mary Sue may be assigned your request and <strong>the only thing she will write for you</strong> is an epic tale of Pike and Una.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your challenge moderator may choose to only allow the "Any" option for offers, or only for certain fields.
