<h4>Include Optional Tags</h4>

<p>
  If you choose this option, then any optional tags you allowed people to set will be used to fulfill 
  required matches on this field. Otherwise, matches on optional tags will only be used to increase the ranking
  of the match.
</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>

<p>
  A challenge requires people to offer and request two fandoms, but also allows them to enter extra fandoms in the optional tags. 
  The moderator promises assignments will match on at least one fandom (and therefore chooses "1" as the number of required fandoms to match). 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jane signs up and requests Star Trek: The Original Series and Deep Space Nine. In her optional tags, she also lists Lower Decks.</li>

<li>Bob signs up and offers Lower Decks and Star Trek: The Next Generation.</li>

<li>Sue signs up and offers Star Trek: The Original Series and Expanded Universes. She also offers Lower Decks in her optional tags.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the moderator turns on "include optional tags" for fandoms, then both Bob and Sue will be potential matches for Jane. 
  Otherwise, only Sue will match with Jane. 
  In both cases, Sue will be ranked as a better match because she also matches Jane in her optional tags.
