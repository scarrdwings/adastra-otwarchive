<h4>Public Skins</h4>

<p>
  This checkbox can only be used by site admins to add new public site skins to 
  our list.  If you want to make one for us, bring it! And if not, you can still make use of
  the user-created skins in <a href="/skins?skin_type=Site">Public Site
  Skins</a> and <a href="/skins?skin_type=WorkSkin">Public Work Skins</a> and
  you can still create skins for your own personal use.
