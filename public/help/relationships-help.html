<h4>Relationships Tags</h4>

<p>(For more information, see the <a href="/faq/tags">Tags on the Ad Astra FAQ</a>.)</p>

<p>The relationships in your work. Full names are preferred (for example, "Benjamin Sisko/Seven of Nine" or "William Riker & Data"). You may list more than one relationship, separated by commas. Please note that all user-created tags must be 100 characters or less; if your work contains a threesome (or a larger poly group) you may want to use last names only to avoid going over the character limit.</p>
