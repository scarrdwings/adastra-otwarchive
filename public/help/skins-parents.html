<h3>Skin Parents</h3>

<p>
  You can combine and layer multiple site skins by making one the parent of
  another. Parent skins are loaded in order so that the style of all the skins
  can be displayed in that order. For more information on skins, please refer to
  <a href="/faq/skins-and-archive-interface">the Skins and Interface FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
  By default, skins will be loaded after Ad Astra's default style. If you don't
  want this, you can specify in the "What it does" menu that you want your skin
  to replace rather than add to the site's default style.
</p>

<h4>Load Ad Astra Skin Components</h4>

<p>
  If you create a replacement skin, you might want to load up all the skins that
  make up the current default Ad Astra site as parents. This option is only
  available when you select "replace archive skin entirely" from the "What it
  does" menu. After that, you can edit your skin and delete just the ones you
  don't want. This will be easier if you are using nearly all of them, since
  there are a lot!
